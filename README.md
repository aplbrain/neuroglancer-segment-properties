# Overview: UI for Segment Properties in Neuroglancer
This system is designed to enable users to generate URLs that link to specific segment properties within Neuroglancer, an interactive web-based tool for visualizing 3D image data. The process involves selecting a datastack and a corresponding table from a dropdown menu, which then triggers a server-side computation to generate a URL that points directly to the configured view in Neuroglancer.
