# Overview: UI for Segment Properties in Neuroglancer
Creating links for segment properties in NeuroglancerThis system is designed to enable users to generate URLs that link to specific segment properties within Neuroglancer, an interactive web-based tool for visualizing 3D image data. The process involves selecting a datastack and a corresponding table from a dropdown menu, which then triggers a server-side computation to generate a URL that points directly to the configured view in Neuroglancer.
